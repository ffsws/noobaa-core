## "Cloud-Native Data-Gateway"

NooBaa is a software defined data gateway for cloud environments, 
providing S3 object-store interface with flexible tiering, mirroring, and spread placement policies, 
over any storage resource that allows GET/PUT including S3, GCS, Azure Blob, Filesystems, etc.

NooBaa simplifies data for admins by connecting to any of the storage silos from private or public clouds, 
and providing a single scalable data service, using the same S3 API and management tools. 
NooBaa allows full control over data placement, letting you place data based on security, 
strategy and cost considerations, in the granularity of an application.
